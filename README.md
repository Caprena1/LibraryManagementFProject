# LibraryManagementFProject
This is an ASP.NETCore MVC Project that empolys the CRUD function
First, I used mySQL to create a library database of books with author ID, name, book title, publication year, ISBN number, checked out and return dates
Using Create, Read, Update and Delete in my application, I began with a static homepage that included buttons for Home and Book Detail
Using IEnumerable, I was able to pull in the book details from mySQL database and VIEW them on my Book Detail page
By activating the title headings, I am able to click on them and sort by authorID, title or name.
I was also able to implement code to create a search bar and search by book title or name
Clicking on the authorID gives me the option to delete a book.
There are also active buttons that allow me to update the checked out and return dates as well as create a new book 
I was able to sucessfully publish this application to the cloud by using Azure
TO DO'S
I have sucessfully migrated the database to the cloud using Azure, but need to determine why it is not loading
Need to determine why my book icon is not loading on my delete and creat a book pages though it is coded in the site.css for the header on every page
Add more books
Add more CSS to my tables
